Consumer:
1) Opens the app
2) Loads a configuration file that holds the promoter's email address
3) Consumer fills out a form
	- First and Last name
	- Number of people
	- Need a table? Yes or No
        - How would you like to be notify?
			- Email address
 			- Text Message 
	- Submit button
4) "Thank you" Message  and/or "Error" Message


Promoter 
1) Recieves an email with the form data
2) Contacts the consumer via email address or text message


Tasks:
- Build the user interface (Ilya)
- Build our the "Request" data model (Ilya)
- Build the configuration file and load it on startup (Ilya)
- Build out the Gateway Service. This should take in all the properties of the form and email it to the promoter (NT)
	- For this one we have to use the "ios grand central dispatch" based on what the TA said. I haven't looked at this yet.
	- Should just be one public method call "sendRequest", maybe just return true or false to let the UI know if it worked or not.
	- Maybe we need to use SendGrid? Need to figure out the easiest way to send an email out to the internet from the iPhone
